If the images were coloured, the shape would have been `(20000, 28, 28, 3)`.\n\nFurther, each of the 20,000 images have a 0-9 label, so `y_train` needs to be of the shape `(20000, 10)` where each image's label is represented as a 10-d **one-hot encoded vector**.\n\nThe shapes of `x_test` and `y_test` will be the same as that of `x_train` and `y_train` respectively.\n\n#### 2.2 Rescaling (Normalisation)\nThe value of each pixel is between 0-255, so we will **rescale each pixel** by dividing by 255 so that the range becomes 0-1.

Note that the kernels have only one channel since the input images are 2D (grayscale). By default, a convolutional layer uses stride of 1 and no padding, so the output from this layer is of shape 26 x 26 x 32, as shown in the summary above (the first element `None` is for the batch size).\n\n- Layer-2 (Conv2D): We have used 64 kernels of size (3, 3), but this time, each kernel has to convolve a tensor of size (26, 26, 32) from the previous layer. Thus, the kernels will also have 32 channels, and so the shape of each kernel is (3, 3, 32) (and we have 64 of them). So we have 64 x 3 x 3 x 32 (weights) + 64 (biases) = 18496 parameters (all trainable). The output shape is (24, 24, 64) since each kernel produces a (24, 24) feature map.\n\n- Max pooling: The pooling layer gets the (24, 24, 64) input from the previous conv layer and produces a (12, 12, 64) output (the default pooling uses stride of 2). There are no trainable parameters in the pooling layer.\n\n- The `Dropout` layer does not alter the output shape and has no trainable parameters.\n\n- The `Flatten` layer simply takes in the (12, 12, 64) output from the previous layer and 'flattens' it into a vector of length 12 x 12 x 64 = 9216.\n\n- The `Dense` layer is a plain fully connected layer with 128 neurons. It takes the 9216-dimensional output vector from the previous layer (layer l-1) as the input and has 128 x 9216 (weights) + 128 (biases) =  1179776 trainable parameters. The output of this layer is a 128-dimensional vector.\n\n- The `Dropout` layer simply drops a few neurons.\n\n- Finally, we have a `Dense` softmax layer with 10 neurons which takes the 128-dimensional vector from the previous layer as input. It has 128 x 10 (weights) + 10 (biases) = 1290 trainable parameters.\n\nThus, the total number of parameters are 1,199,882 all of which are trainable.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#  4.
